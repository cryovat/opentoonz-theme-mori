# Mori theme for OpenToonz

Mori is an experimental theme for [OpenToonz](https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz), attempting to give the software a
slightly more modern look (which is mostly an euphenism for emulating the Creative Suite style).

It is based on the bundled **gray_048** with custom modifications.

Apart from a tiny custom piece, icons come from three sources:

 * Icons from the [OpenToonz](https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz) project
 * Material Design icons by [Google](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)
 * Material Design icons by [Templarian](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign)
